00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is the capital of France?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,800
If you are curious about the capital of France,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,640
you might be surprised to learn that it has not always been Paris.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,000
Paris is the current and most populous capital of France,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,040
with more than 2 million residents in an area of 105 square kilometers.

Some of the other cities that have served as the capital of France include
